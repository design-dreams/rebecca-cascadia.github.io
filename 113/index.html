                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>GoingGlobalU enables university faculty to find other education partners worldwide, then to design and       participate in student learning projects as part of their regular classrooms. 
                University faculty complete profiles on themselves, their course and their classroom, and then use this site to find other educators with matching interests. Resources are available to help you design and implement your Collaborative On-line international Learning (COIL) courses.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>In the 1990’s, the internet opened up exciting new avenues for global communication, commerce and education.  No longer did we have to rely on travel to have meaningful, live conversations. We could learn and work together, but to communicate effectively when not face to face, required new ways of thinking and interacting to be successful. Many k-12 schools began to experiment with these new virtual tools to help students connect across countries and cultures, yet universities remained woefully behind. Yet universities are ripe for some of the richest dialogue and problem-solving education activities. The skills needed in today’s work world, and in civil society to find solutions to the global issues we face require us become highly competent in cross-cultural communication and virtual problem-solving.
                There is a growing demand among students and educators today to have our universities help students practice these skills across all subject areas.  A key challenge has been to develop a tool to help educators in our universities efficiently find good matches for their students in the areas they teach.  GoingGlobalU was developed to address that need.</p>
