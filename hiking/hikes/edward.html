      <dt>Trail information</dt>
      <dd>Located in between Kirkland and Kenmore, this trail is a 3 mile loop with
      an elevation gain of 400ft, although you start at the top and go down
      to the water. The trail is shady and kind of washed out a bit, but it's
      a beautiful place to walk.
      Dogs are allowed. There is a bathroom by the playground and also one in
      the smaller building to the right. There's also one near the water.
      There are several trails,
      but the longest is around the outskirts of the park. To get to the trail,
      there is a path from the far right parking lot. It'll take you down
      to the water. There are several trails to your left near the water, but
      just go straight and eventually you'll come out near the playground. Don't
      forget to sit by the water a bit and enjoy the view!</dd>
