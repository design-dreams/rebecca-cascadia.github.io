      <dt>Trail information</dt>
      <dd>Located in North Bend, this trail is 4 miles round trip with
      an elevation gain of 1160ft. It is shady, except for at the top. It's very popular on
      weekends. Dogs are allowed and many people bring them. There are many
      port-a-potties at the trailhead,
      although there are a couple in the parking area as well. To get to the trail,
      there is a wide gravel path around the right side of the lake to get to
      the trailhead, which is marked well. When you get to the ledge, be careful as
      there is a drop off and people have been careless and fallen off. It's easy
      to stay safe though, by not getting close to the edge. The rock ledge is a
      pretty big area where one can sit, have a snack and enjoy the view.</dd>
