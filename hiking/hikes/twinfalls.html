      <dt>Trail information</dt>
      <dd>Located in North Bend, this trail is 2.6 miles round trip with
      an elevation gain of 500ft, although it feels like more because there
      are many ups and downs. Dogs are allowed. There is a pit toilet at the
      trailhead. This trail is my favorite. The sound of the
      river is amazing here and the falls are so beautiful. There is a bridge
      over the falls. This is the turn around point. You can't get lost here.
      There is a short trail off to the right side with stairs at one point.
      It's just a another place to view the falls, but they are pretty far
      away from this point.</dd>
