      <dt>Trail information</dt>
      <dd>Located in Duvall, this trail is 5 miles round trip with some hills.
       Dogs are allowed. There is no bathroom at the trailhead. There are very
       few people on this trail. This trail has
       no markers, so here are the directions:
       <ol>
         <li>There is a blue metal gate where the trail begins on Mountain View Drive,
           although I'm not sure the gate is seen right at the road.</li>
         <li>After about 3/4 mile, there will be a bridge crossing Margaret Creek.
           Cross the bridge. At the second junction after the bridge, turn right
           and go uphill.</li>
         <li>After about 1 1/2 miles, at the third junction, turn right.
           Shortly after, you'll see an old car.</li>
         <li>Keep going and you'll walk through a shallow creek. Listen for
           the falls. They will be off to your right and won't be difficult to find from here.</li>
       </ol>
      </dd>
      <dt>Directions</dt>
      <dd><ol>

          head north on SR 203 for about 500 feet.</li>
        <li>Turn right onto NE Cherry Valley Road.</li>
        <li>Continue on this road for 4.3 miles.</li>
        <li>Turn left on Mountain View Road.</li>
        <li>The trail head is immediately to your right about 50 feet from the intersection.</li>

      </ol></dd>
