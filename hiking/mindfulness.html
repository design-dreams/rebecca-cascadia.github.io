     <h2>Mindfulness</h2>
     <p>We may walk in nature forgetting that we are nature. We surround ourselves
       in stagnant spaces that change only if we change them. Nature is always
       changing and so are we if we allow it. How do you allow it? Space. Like
       the white space on a page, we need space to be able to see. If there were
       no space on a page, how could you read my words? The page would be black.
       Your mind needs space too. Walking in nature gives us space, to think,
       process and just enjoy being alive. It puts life into perspective.</p>

     <p>What is mindfulness? It is awareness, pure awareness of everything just
       the way it is. Many things we do can be mindless or our thoughts can be
       mindless. Mindfulness is the opposite of mindlessness. It is being in
       this moment and realizing this experience right now is unique; it’s never
       happened before. The past is not happening anymore, the future is unknown.</p>

     <p>Mindfulness can be used on your hike to connect to this moment in
        complete gratitude for being alive and being able to experience everything
        around you. As you walk, notice the plants and animals without labeling
        them. Just see them for what they are. Be an observer. Look at them like
        you’ve never seen them before, because you never have. You may have seen
        something similar. Your brain fills in information based on past experiences
        and tends to ignore the familiar. Notice what you see, what you hear and
        what you smell as you walk. Notice what you are thinking. Allow any thoughts
        or feelings to arise without judgment. Try this out for any period of
        time you’d like, be it 10 minutes or the whole hike. It’s up to you.</p>

     <p>Sitting meditation is another option. Find a good spot to sit in the
        forest or near a river. Close your eyes and listen to all of the sounds
        near and then far. Notice any scents. Relax any tense muscles. Notice
        any thoughts you have without judgment. Notice your breath for a few
        minutes. Don't try to change it. Open your eyes and notice
        everything around you. Bring a journal to write down anything important
        that comes up for you.</p>

     <p>Another idea is to set an intention during your hike. What do you desire?
        What matters most to you? This is not like an
        everyday goal. It's more like a heart-centered, spiritual goal, like
        to be more loving or peaceful. It's best to do this in a calm state.</p>
