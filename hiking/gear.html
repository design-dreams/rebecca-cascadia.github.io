     <h2>Gear and Safety Tips</h2>
     <h3>Basic Gear</h3>
     <p>This can really depend on the hike, but the basics are a water bottle
        and decent hiking boots. Waterproof boots are the best, keeping your
        feet dry after stepping through puddles and mud. There have been many
        times I was happy I had them.</p>
     <h3>Discover Pass</h3>
     <p>You may need a <a href="http://discoverpass.wa.gov">Discover Pass</a>
        to park. They can be ordered online, but
        I’ve seen places to pay for them in the parking lots of where they are
        required.</p>
     <h3>Rain and Cold</h3>
     <p>If it’s raining or cold, things change a bit. Wearing layers is a good
        idea. You might be surprised at how warm you can get. If rain is
        possible, a good rain jacket or lightweight umbrella is helpful. You’ll
        also want pants that don’t soak up water. Jeans are the worst. Fleece is
        good or a fabric that doesn’t hold water well. Some people wear rain pants.</p>
     <h3>Hiking Alone</h3>
     <p>I love hiking alone, but play it safe and only do that if the hike is a
        popular one where you can get help if you need it. You’ll want to go with
        someone on the Cherry Creek Falls hike. The other hikes are pretty popular
        on nice weekends. If you’d like to hike with a group and don’t have
        friends who want to go, there are many hiking groups on
        <a href="http://www.meetup.com">Meetup</a>.</p>
     <h3>Health</h3>
     <p>Make sure you are in good health before you go. If
        you have any question about it, get your doctor’s okay. It can take
        awhile for emergency crews to get to people on a trail.</p>
     <h3>Food</h3>
     <p>I often like to bring a snack to eat at the midpoint of a hike or during
        if I get hungry. Some trail mix, a bar, fruit or veggies, or a sandwich
        are some good options. Energy can get low and a quick snack can be
        just what you need to enjoy the rest of your hike.</p>
     <h3>Backpack</h3>
     <p>A backpack is nice to have to store snacks, a water bottle, extra layers,
        keys, etc. You could also put a first aid kit in there and tissues.</p>
     <h3>Trip Reports</h3>
     <p>It’s a good idea to check trip reports before going to a trail.
        These reports are done by other hikers about their recent visit and
        describe what the trail was like and any suggestions or warnings.
        After your hike, you may want to post about your own experience.
        One place to find trip reports is on the website for the
        <a href="http://www.wta.org">Washington Trails Association</a>.</p>
     <h3>Animals</h3>
     <p>I haven’t seen bears or cougars on the hikes I’ve been on, but they are
        out there. If you are concerned, there are websites that explain what to
        do if you see them. Please don't feed any wild animals. There are
        chipmunks at the top of Rattlesnake Ledge.</p>
     <h3>Stinging Nettle</h3>
     <p>This is a plant you should know about. If it is touched, the tiny hairs
       will make your skin sting and burn. Rinse immediately with water and find
       a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystichum_munitum">sword fern</a>.
        There are many in this area.
       The brown spore pods on the underside of the fern can be rubbed
       against the skin to help reduce the irritation.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urtica_dioica">Stinging nettle</a>
        is an amazing plant
       though, as people use it as a tea to reduce seasonal allergies and the
       leaves are edible if they are sauteed or baked like kale chips.</p>
     <aside>**I’m not liable for any accidents due to the advice I give here.
        Please do your own research before hiking. Just sharing what I know
        from years of doing short hikes in the area.</aside>
