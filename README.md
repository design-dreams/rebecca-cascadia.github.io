Class work for BIT 175: Front End Development at Cascadia College in Bothell, WA
================================================================================

First introduction to GitHub in this class.

We created three different websites, each due within a two week period that included more than what is shown here;
like design sketches, color palette selection, heuristics of comparable websites, etc. A portfolio to include these
websites was also created.

I've learned so much!
